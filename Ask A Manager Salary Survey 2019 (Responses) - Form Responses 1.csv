I'll also use this box to comment on ""post-college professional work experience,"" as asked about in the last question. I completed my degree after dropping out for medical and financial reasons at age 20 and working for several years. So based on your question, post-college, I have 5 years. But really, I have more like 13 years of adult work experience. Many other professionals do not enroll in or complete college, as well. I imagine this has some impact on salary!",

Each DBU handles the end-to-end online marketing, business sourcing, and delivery for a particular financial product, or portfolio of products. Ours, for instance, handles a particular type of popular loan. 

There's a DBU Head (basically, national manager), who keeps the shop running and holds the threads. He has under him 2-3 sub-verticals, each headed by a Lead (basically, senior manager) who handles one complete aspect of the product.This could be business sourcing and delivery, or technology development, or partnerships. They have their own reportees who handle individual portions of each aspect. Example, one Lead handles all of sourcing and delivery. Under her, she has a bunch of Senior Unit Managers, each of whom acts as an individual contributor for say, email marketing, or native campaigns, or funnel efficiency. Our volumes are high enough to require such hyper-specialised distribution, though everyone has some idea of each other's work. 

My Lead handles content and content marketing. I work directly under the Content Lead for our business, and my role focuses on keeping tabs on the daily production of content, assignation of briefs, strategic planning for content marketing activities, etc. etc. My boss and I share many of these duties, as they're too much for one person - while I own the day-to-day decisions and work, he's the final word on the overall shape of things. 

We also have a junior colleague who reports directly to my manager. While he takes the final calls on her performance and work assignments, her day-to-day mentoring and management is done by me. My job title effectively equates to being a manager, due to the expertise and experience required for my role, although the people I manage are agencies, rather than having direct reports.
